			<p>Hand gesture recognition is very significant for human-computer interaction.s
		In this work, we present a novel real-time method for hand gesture recognition. The proposed
		system is vision based, which uses machine learning techniques and inputs from a computer
		webcam. Vision based gesture recognition tracking and gesture recognition in our framework,
		the hand region is extracted from the background with the background subtraction method.
		Finally, a rule classifier is applied to predict the labels of hand gestures. Our method shows
		better performance than a state-of-art method on another data set of hand gestures</p>
	<h3 class="head2">More about our project</h3>Our projects maps out the users hand based on the "Hand Landmark Model".
		<img src="hand_model.jpg" ,="" class="left">A hand landmark model that operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints.Research in the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) and its use in virtual environments are done a lot lately. Researchers have attempted to use video devices for HCI to identify virtual objects in order to control the system environment. Various natural motions can be identified, tracked, and analyzedby utilizing web cameras as the input device.A hand gesture controller, also known as human activity gesture, detects hand movement.Gesture recognition makes it easy to use a variety of devices, including personal navigation devices, computers, laptops, mobile phones, smart TV etc. The growth trend of touchless gesture recognition in niche applications, including games, could boost the growth of the touchless sensor market during the forecast period. Medical applications have additional gesture recognition capabilities that nursesand doctors may not be able to touch the display or trackpad for health and safety reasons, but still need to control the system. Proper gestures, such as swiping by hand or using your finger as a keyboard, are a safer and faster way to control your device.<p></p>

		Advantages of having a Virtual Keyboard </h3><img src="gestures.jpg" ,="" class="right">
		<ol>
		<li>We do not have to actually touch any surface to type.</li>
		<li>We can stand at a distance from the monitor and the computer will still track our gestures efficiently.</li>
		<li>With the current pandemic situation, it provides a way to reduce infection through touch.</li>
